# Sitebricks

Sitebricks is a simple, fast development layer for Java web apps. It is built on top of [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice)
and follows many of the same principles of type-safety and conciseness.

Sitebricks offers several modules that fit various kinds of web development needs including Web Services,
Templating, Mail, HTTP Clients, and more. Sitebricks is maintained by an active community of developers
 and is open source software available under the [Apache license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
 You are free to use Sitebricks in commercial and hobby projects, with no copyright restrictions or
 fees.
